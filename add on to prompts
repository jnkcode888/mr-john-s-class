The prompt you shared is already solid, but for **truly viral** content — especially for Gen Z in Kenya — you'll want to **add some extra spice manually**. Here's what you can add **every time** (or bake into the updated prompt) to *sharpen the edge and boost virality*:

---

### ✅ Manual Add-Ons for VIRAL Reels (Add to Prompt Code or Story Instructions):

#### 1. **Relatability Layer**

Add:

> * Include *real-life, Kenyan-style examples* to make abstract AI topics feel personal (e.g. “imagine AI sounding like your mum…”)
> * Mention common Kenyan tech habits or culture (e.g. "WhatsApp groups", "MPESA scammers", "shakisha AI", "Wueh AI ni kama ex wangu!")

---

#### 2. **Drama Dial-Up**

Add:

> * Use strong emotional words — *“insane,” “crazy,” “shocking,” “dangerous,” “illegal”*
> * Add twists like *"but wait, it gets worse…"*, *"you won’t believe this part…"*, or *"ati AI did WHAT?"*

---

#### 3. **Sound & Visual Cues**

Add:

> * Insert suggested sound effects like **\[ding!]**, **\[dramatic pause]**, **\[👀 emoji moment]**, or even **\[cut to AI voice saying nonsense]**
> * Mention where quick cuts or memes could go — e.g. **\[insert meme of confused guy blinking]**

---

#### 4. **TikTok/IG Trends Integration**

Add:

> * Reference viral phrases or formats (like “POV: AI is your bestie 👀” or “When AI starts acting like your ex 💀”)
> * If possible, match the tone to a trending TikTok/IG sound (e.g. "Use the 'Sheesh' sound for the last line")

---

#### 5. **Kenyanness, Unfiltered**

Add:

> * Drop in sheng, local phrases: *“sijui kama uko ready,” “gai!” “msee aliweza,” “uko na AI ama AI iko na wewe?”*
> * Keep it *mtaa-level real* — like explaining to a friend in a matatu or at Kenyatta Market

---

### 🔁 Example Final CTA Upgrades:

Instead of:

> "Follow for your weekly AI fix — usikose next one!"

Try:

* **"Hit follow ama AI itakuchukua na voice yako 🤣"**
* **"Next week’s story ni even more mad — usikose!"**
* **"Wachana na Netflix, AI news ndio blockbuster sai 🎬"**

### 🔥 What to Add to Each Prompt:

When building your final prompt, just include this line near the end:

> “After rewriting the script, add 1–2 lines of relatable Kenyan flavor, 1 viral-sounding phrase, and suggest a meme or TikTok-style cut to boost engagement.”
